                <h1 class="display-2">How to run the application</h1>
                <h2>Accessing the web application online</h2>
                <p>
                    Just click on the provided link to access the web application hosted on the EVL server from your browser. It is recommended to use a recent version of Google Chrome.

                </p>
                <h2>Hosting the web application locally</h2>

                Clone the project repository. Open app.R with RStudio, download <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/" style="text-decoration: underline">RStudio</a> and <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" style="text-decoration: underline">R</a> if you don't have them installed on your machine. Download all the R libraries used in the project executing the command install.packages("library") in the RStudio console. The application. The application queires data realtime from the various data sources Array of Things, Darksky , Open AQ and Chicago Traffic Tracker in order to perform various visualizations. Please follow the below steps to do the required preprocessing before running the application to generate the data again.
                <ul>
                    <li>There are n preprocessing required to generate the necessary data files for the application:<h4> blah blah</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li> instructions
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Once we have all the neceessary data/fst files , we can now proceed with running of the application.
                Run the application via RStudio by clicking Run App at the top right on the main RStudio panel. Access it using a browser and with the local machine address and port on which the application is started. (<a href="http://127.0.0.1:port_num/" style="text-decoration: underline">http://127.0.0.1:port/</a>)
                <br><br>

                <h1 class="display-2">Functionalities</h1>

                <h2>Getting started and Sidebar</h2>

                The application starts in full screen. You can open the menu items for different categories in the sidebar to see more options. The inputs item helps the user to switch between metric or imperial units for the whole application , to enable or disable the heatmap visualization and to show/hide the sensor nodes in the tabular form.

                <h2>Map</h2>

                This application has only one main page, a full screen map centered in the Chicago area. On the map there are sensor nodes that can be clicked by the user to get real-time, as well as historical data from it. There is also real-time traffic data that can also be clicked on to get more information.

                As the rest of the application, this map is responsive and particularly, it was created for the big wall of display that we have in the classroom (11520 by 3240 pixels). In order to allow a practical user experience in terms of the touch screen wall present in the classroom, the UI has been designed to work best in this configuration that is the one applied to this version of the application:

                <div class="testimonials__slide">
                    <div class="testimonials__info">
                    </div>
                    <img src="/images/p3viz/1.png" alt="Screen" class="responsive">
                </div>

                <h4>Nodes</h4>
                Nodes are groups of various hardware sensors located in the Chicago area. Each node has multiple sensors in it.
                The nodes come from 2 different sources: <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/">Array of Things</a> and <a href="https://openaq.org/">Open Air Quality</a>. The AoT nodes are blue, the OpenAQ green. The red nodes are the inactive nodes from AoT. Inactive nodes are all the nodes which are deployed but when queried respond with no observation for each sensor they have.<br>
                By clicking on any node, a popup will appear showing more information about the node. The node is also queried and by waiting a few seconds it is possible to visualize the data it provides in the plot panel. We also query at the same time the <a href="https://darksky.net/">Dark Sky</a> APIs that retrieve weather data and other measures for any node and they are displayed in the plots panel as well. Keep in mind that it could take a while to load they are real time data. Especially for the last 7 days and 24 hours the data gathering and preprocessing is really slow, because multiple requests are performed and in particular the AoT APIs have a very slow response time.

                    <div class="testimonials__info">

                    <img src="/images/p3viz/2.png" alt="Screen" class="responsive">
                </div>

                <h4>Nodes Table</h4>
The different Array of Things nodes along with their location are shown in tabular form on the left. The table can be shown and hidden based on the user preference. The table show the information about the various AoT nodes, what measures they are reporting and the node overall status active or inactive. The nodes which are reporting measures have "True" corresponding for that measure. The user can filter using the checkboxes below in the panel to show and hide sites based on the measures selected.

                </div>


                <h4>Map background</h4>
                The map background can be changed by clicking on the select boxes in the layers menu. There are 4 different map backgrounds. The default is a drawn map with train stations, streets and highways, parks and icons for most important locations.<br>
                The Dark Matter allows to make good use of the different colors (traffic and nodes) that pop out on the black background.<br>
                The satellite is a usual satellite image of Chicago.
                The terrain is a mix of all the previous features: allows to better visualize colors given that the predominant color is white/grey, it has terrain features (see the green areas and water), it has streets and highways highlighted.

                <h4>Traffic Data</h4>
                Traffic data come from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/n4j6-wkkf">Chicago Traffic Tracker</a>.
                This data is real-time (at most 20 minutes ago) data that describe the congestion status in the streets of Chicago.
                In particular, the dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.<br>
                We decided to integrate traffic data because it could help explain and give a cause to the real-time variations of pollutants such as CO, PM2.5, PM10, NO2 that are also produced by vehicles.
                The roads are colored followed usual traffic color used in common GPS navigation applications (e.g. Google Maps). The colors conventions are: grey, no traffic (no cars or no data provided), blue: normal/high speed and above, yellow: medium speed, orange: low speed, red: very low or zero speed.<br>
                Each road is clickable and more information are provided in a popup.

                <h2>Heatmap</h2>
The Heatmap can be use be used to visualize the various measure intensity across the city of Chicago. The Heatmap has three inputs : Type of Measure, Value Type (min,max,averga) and time range (current, last 24 hours and last 7 days). The user can select any measure from the dropdown for the three data sources and visualize it for various values type and time duration. The Heatmap is created by interpolation all the nodes data for a particular data source in order to get better data for visualization for the entire city of chicago. Based on the amount of data available, the interpolation is not possible because of very less number of nodes reporting and a message is shown indicating that on the screen. There is a legend available for the heatmap which tell about the value being shown on the heatmap.

                <h4>Plots panel</h4>

                This is the most important panel of the application. It shows the data queried by the various nodes in the form of line charts or tabular form.
                The inputs present in this panel are two: the first one is the time range, which can be selected from current (or most recent data), last 24 hours and last 7 days data. The second one is a set of checkboxes that allow the users to select only the pollutants features that they want to visualize.<br>
                The first plot shows the last clicked node data. The bottom one, instead, shows the previously selected node. This allows a comparison between nodes data.

                <h4>Using traffic data</h4>
                As explain in the documentation, using traffic data could help explain and give a cause to the real-time variations of pollutants such as CO, PM2.5, PM10, NO2 that are also produced by vehicles. A strategy to do this kind of visual analytics with the application would be to select in the layers the nodes that give information about those pollutants, then select nodes with different type of traffic and compare the current pollutants value. Unfortunately, the data provided by the nodes is not really good, the CO measurement is most of the times negative (and the APIs don't explain what could be the meaning of negative values, it could be that it means that it is 0), the NO2 is 0 everywhere in Chicago, and the pm2.5 and pm10 are almost not provided by any sensor. For the sake of explaining the application's functionalities, I provide a screenshot of what the application looks like when interactions of this type are performed.

                <h4>Last 7 days, downtown vs uptown</h4>
                I tried to compare 2 different locations in terms of traffic, buildings, amount of people, closeness to the lake.
                The upper plot shows the data for the last 7 days for a node located in uptown, close to the lake. The bottom plot shows data for the last 7 days for a node located in downtown, a little more west (further from the lake).
                The things that I noticed are that: downtown the humidity level is more constant and overall less than uptown. H2S is only present downtown (it is 0 in the 08F node), the temperature is higher in uptown.

                <h1 class="display-2">Weekly Updates on progress</h1>
                <h1 style="font-size: 32pt">Week 1</h1>
                <h2>Mirko</h2>
                For the first week I started my work by designing the initial high-level Graphical User Interface with sidebar, tabs, colors. I then concentrated on the Array of Things APIs. I integrated useful functions that we would need in our project inspired by the official R wrapper APIs that are currently not working. I noticed that there were a few problems in the AoT APIs, and with the queries that they provide it is tricky to get the initial information that we need for the map (dataset with all the nodes and the sensor that each node provides). Since right now there is no trivial way (apparently) to get the sensors list from a node, I got the same information parsing the observations of each individual node, this process is slow due to the need of querying each node and slow response from the AoT servers, it takes approximately 30 seconds. Once I created the needed dataset I noticed some interesting problems: only 38 nodes currently responde with data observations (the toal number of nodes already deployed is 119). Also, I cannot explain why 2 nodes with different vsn (070 and 072) have same exact location and address. I then plotted on the map the locations of the sensors and created the selection layers for the users, where they can select to visualize only part a subset of sensors.
                I saved the nodes information in FST format and created a variable that controls the update of the nodes information or retrieves the previously saved one. I also created a basic plot and the comparison for the Current data and all of the tracked measures coming from the AoT source: when clicking on a node the plot is displayed for the selected measures, the user can also select another node and compare it two the previous one by visualizing an identical plot below the most recent's one.

                <h2>Abhishek</h2>
                Started working on preprocessing the OpenAQ data. Task is to bring it to a certain dataframe format, so that reading it becomes easy.
                <h2>Ashwani</h2>
                During this week, I tried working with the R library for AoT and contacted the owner of repository for a fix for the recent changes.
                We then moved forward with using the AoT API directly. We discussed about the various project requirements and how to implement them.
                I worked on creating some of the graphical charts for the Array of Things data and added corresponding units of measure for them.


                <h1 style="font-size: 32pt">Week 2</h1>
                <h2>Mirko</h2>
                If I thought the Array of Things data source was bad from the first week impressions, now I can confirm this is the worst APIs and service I've ever used. The challenges I faced this week were related to showing the last 24 hours and last 7 days of data in a line chart upon clicking on a sensor. I discovered that a lot of sensor that have data, randomly shut down and turn back on disrupting the service and making it difficult to understand what is going on with the data. I had trouble in finding a node which was pretty good in terms of providing data constantly, eventually I picked node 08D. The issue now was on how to query the API s to get the data I wanted. I initially tried to get all the observations in the last 24 hours and then preprocess them. I soon realized the infeasibility of this method because of the latency in downloading and preprocessing such a large quantity of data (around 100k rows) in real-time. It would take around 1 minute from when the user clicks the node to when the plot is generated. Way too much. I thought about a possible implementation in which data for each node are preloaded and processed when the application starts but that would take too much time and the user expects reactivity quickly. My final solution to solve this problem was that of subsampling the data (200 obs each hour/day) based on the timestamp. It also took me a long time to figure out how to create an HTTP request to the AoT APIs filtering based on timestamp. The official APIs documentation as of now lacks examples or proper explanation. Eventually I got it to work. Another cool surprised AoT gave us is that there are places in Chicago with -30 ppm of so2, which would be great if it was true but I'm afraid it's not really physically possible.


                <h2>Abhishek</h2>
                Done with the preprocessing script for openAQ data. Need to start working on creating 4 new tabs for displaying graph and tables for two subsets of data identified during our discussion.
                <h2>Ashwani</h2>
                During this week, I created the table for node and sensor information for Array of Things dataset. I then worked on the tabular visualzation for Darksky for the current time in a separte panel. The functionality to filter sites based on measures was added for the table representation of the sites. The graphical charts for Array of Things now can take input from the table and show corresponding visualizations. The selection of multiple inputs from table is a bit tricky and needs to be looked into in detail for the comparsion task.



                <h1 style="font-size: 32pt">Alpha version</h1>
                <h2>Mirko</h2>
                During the third week and for the Alpha version I integrated OpenAQ nodes on map, created nodes legend in map, added 4 different map backgrounds and refreshing the charts every minute which completed all the C requirements.

                <h2>Abhishek</h2>
                Merged panels for openAQ and AoT pollutants which will be tab 1. Tab 2 will contain other variables like intensity, humidity, etc. Merge needs to be done for this also which will act as tab 2.

                <h2>Ashwani</h2>
                During this week, I fixed the map and table inputs issue for graphical plots to handle them independently. I preprocessed the darksky data and created the 24 hours and last 7 days charts for Darksky. I worked on the issue of comparison of plots where same nodes were being shown on comparsion. The comparison fix currently has been done for Array of Things map and table inputs and needs to be added for Darksky once the reorganization of charts is done.



                <h1 style="font-size: 32pt">Week 4</h1>
                <h2>Mirko</h2>
                After the professor's approval on the new data source to be used as a graduate additional requirement, I integrated real-time traffic and congestion data taken from <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofchicago.org/n4j6-wkkf">Chicago Traffic Tracker</a> in the application. In particular, the dataset comes with 5 important features, which are: start and end of longitude and latitude and current traffic speed. I decided to show thid data graphically on the map by creating colored lines with the following color convention.
                colors: grey, no traffic (no cars), blue: normal/high speed and above, yellow: medium speed, orange: low speed, red: very low or zero speed.
                By clicking on a street, a popup appears showing data such as: the name of the main street and the crossings it joins, numeric speed in mph, link to APIs.
                The street layers can be toggled on or off from the respective layers menu.



                <h2>Abhishek</h2>

                <h2>Ashwani</h2>
                During this week, I changed the sensor table presentation to make it visually better. I fixed the filtering of sites from sensor table to show sites based on measure availability. I added a button to hide the table based on user preference. I fixed various issues related to graphical plots for Darksky. I started working on the heatmaps and preprocessed the Array of Things API data required for its heatmap.


                <h1 style="font-size: 32pt">Final delivery</h1>
                <h2>Mirko</h2>
                For the final week I adjusted all the sizes to make the application work well on the class wall, fixed some recurrent bugs. I also tried to decrease the loading time for the last 24 hours data for the Array of Things by getting all the entries in the last 24 hours, the advantage of this over the method in which I get samples of data for each hour is that only 1 request has to be made, and AoT has a slow response time so 1 request with a lot more data is faster than 24 requests with small data. The problem here was that if you pass as query parameters the instants defining the interval between now and 24 hours ago and don't modify the maximum size of the retrieved data, you will only get 200 results. If instead you modify the size, there is a limit of 100k in the API that is not enought for some nodes that could have more than 100k entries in the last 24 hours. In the end I decided to just switch back to the old and slow method. There is not much we can do to improve the speed of data gathering and plot generation for AoT since their APIs are the main bottleneck and they are also not working as expected.
                <h2>Abhishek</h2>

                <h2>Ashwani</h2>
                During this week, I worked on completing the heatmaps for all the three data sources, Array of Things, Darksky and OpenAq.
                I did preprocessing for all the three data source to get data for all the nodese for them. I created the various inputs for heatmaps for all the required measures. The heatmaps are created for various type of values min,max,average, for all time ranges current, last 24 hours and last 7 days. The randomization of Darksky key is done to select any key at random for a given set of keys. I fixed the slowness of previous click on the graphical plots. I explored the possibility of saving the previous data but it might causes some problems so the data is queried in real time which might affect performance depending on the response time of API and amount of data requested.
